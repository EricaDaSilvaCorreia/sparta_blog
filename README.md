##### Challenges :

This assignment felt like I was playing operation but whenever I tried to remove the toilet from the stomach the frog in the heart would buzz.

##### Take-Aways :

All in all I understand the concept, the similarities with what we did last week helped me find my footing and after that everything was okay. It's just the first day of working with rails so I'm just waiting to see how it goes. It is relatively easier than what we did last week but still there are things I can see will require a lot of practice.

I give it a 6/10.
